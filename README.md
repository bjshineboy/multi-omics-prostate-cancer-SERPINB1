SERPINB1 Epigenetic Regulation in Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Immune Evasion

Project Title: Multi-Omics Integration Reveals SERPINB1 Epigenetic Silencing as a Key Mediator of Immunosuppressive Microenvironment and Metastasis in Prostate Cancer

This repository contains the complete code and data required to reproduce the analyses and figures from the aforementioned study. The research employs integrative multi-omics analyses to elucidate the role of SERPINB1 promoter hypermethylation in driving immune evasion and metastatic progression in prostate cancer (PCa).

🔬 Study Overview

This study integrates data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), single-cell/spatial transcriptomics, ChIP-seq, and a clinical cohort (n=54) to demonstrate:
• Mechanism: SERPINB1 silencing, mediated by promoter hypermethylation, facilitates neutrophil elastase (NE) activity, promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment.

• Key Findings: SERPINB1 loss in Club-like cells correlates with elevated CXCL1/2/8 expression, MAPK/c-FOS signaling activation, and recruitment of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs).

• Clinical Relevance: SERPINB1 hypermethylation is an independent prognostic factor associated with shorter progression-free survival and higher Gleason scores.

• Translation: Urinary SERPINB1 promoter methylation shows promise as a non-invasive diagnostic biomarker.


🚀 Quick Start Guide

1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have R (version ≥ 4.2.0) installed. Required R packages can be installed using the following command in your R console:
# List of required packages
packages <- c("data.table", "ggplot2", "survival", "Seurat", "clusterProfiler", "dplyr", "readr", "IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno")
# Install packages not yet installed
install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))


2. Reproducing the Analysis
To regenerate a specific figure (e.g., Figure 2), open the corresponding script in RStudio or run it via the command line:
Rscript Figure2.R


Note: Some scripts (e.g., Figure2.R) may call subsidiary scripts (e.g., Figure2.A.R) located in the respective FigureX_Data/ folders. Ensure all relative paths are correct.

3. Data Preparation
• Public Data: Raw data from TCGA, GEO, etc., should be downloaded from their respective portals and placed in the data/ directory. The scripts contain comments indicating the source of each dataset.

• Processed Data: Intermediate and processed data files generated by the scripts are saved in the corresponding FigureX_Data/ folders.

📊 Data Availability

• The processed multi-omics data required to run the code in this repository is available from the Science Data Bank (ScienceDB).

⚠️ Important Notes

• Paths: Scripts use relative paths. Please set your working directory to SERPNB1_sci_20250829 or open the Integrated Multi-omics Biomarker.Rproj file in RStudio before running scripts.

• Computational Resources: Analyses involving large datasets (e.g., single-cell data) may require substantial memory (≥16 GB RAM).

• Data Preprocessing: Some raw data files (e.g., .gz from TCGA) require decompression before analysis. Refer to script headers for specific instructions.
